Simplicity - Week#1 Journal Entry

Mayank Tanwar

Simplicity is one of the key feature of the XP values, following simplicity rule we can prevent unnecessary overheads that comes in rapidly changing requirement of our software development process.
The main mantra is keep it simple and do what is asked for and not more than that. If a button is need to be created write the code what is required rather than adding multiple functionalities to tackle future changes. 

FromÂ Extreme Programming Explained:
"XP is making a bet. It is betting that it is better to do a simple thing today and pay a little more tomorrow to change it if it needs it, than to do a more complicated thing today that may never be used anyway."

In our brainstorming session we came up with many ideas, we discussed the vision, adaptability, implementation and basic flow of the project. All the open ended ideas were discarded and more emphasis was on the close ended suggestion which can take real world form in few iterations. 

Following the simplicity values, we can brainstorm more ideas and finalize the idea having all the basic ingredients to be a potential project. Using it we can save time as we will be discussing what is needed rather than discussing what can be needed in future. We will focus on taking small step by step to reach our goal and handling failure as they happen.
