Minimal spanning tree algorithm is the way to find the minimum distance between two points.
When finite directed graph is given, then from any node from grapg to any other node in the same graph can be traversed using with minimum distance.
Travelling salesman problem is the famous problem which is solved by using the minimal spanning tree algorithm.
In the game, we can designt the city. There will vaious spots in the city which will serve as the nodes in the graph.
Distance between all connected nodes will given in miles.
When Player starts the game, he/she will get the car.
He/she has to drive to the destination which is also another spot in city. Driver will car to next connected spot.
Once he/she reach the next spot, driver can see the distance of all connected spots from the spot where he/she is currently.

Coditions.
There will be limited fuel in the car which is sufficient for the car to reach the destination with shortest possible path.
If driver takes wrong path, then car's fuel tank will get empty in between and game will be lost.
We can hint menu where player can the see the distance between all the nodes for limited number of times.
